1. First Fit: 20MB, 10MB, 18MB
   Best Fit: 12MB, 10MB, 9MB
   Worst Fit: 20MB, 18MB, 15MB

2. 20000: page number - 4   offset - 3616
   32768: page number - 8   offset - 0
   60000: page number - 14  offset - 2656

3. 1048576 - pages exist
   3 X pagesize + offset = 116 bit page size

4. These algorithms would be awful for this process as
   they base the order of processes of certain aspects of
   each process, so it would be hard to go from 0-511 in order
   and then after that determine a process is next by random.
   An algorithm that would be optimal for this problem is an algorithm
   that gives each page a value for the order it is between 0 511,
   which could be easily looked up to determine which one is next.
   Next, it would have to have the ability to randomly select a page,
   so it can be selected in between each order.

5. FIFO - 4
   LRU  - 3
