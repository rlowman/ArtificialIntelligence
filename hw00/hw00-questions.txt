CS364 Operating Systems

1. The two main functions of the operating system are to provide application
programmers a clean abstract set of resources and to manage these hardware
resources.

2. Instructions that access input/ output devices are only usable in kernel mode
so that the drivers can read and write to the registers. 

3. (a) Because if the interrupts are disabled in user mode instead of kernel
mode, the CPU is not going to be able to decide which device to let their
signals run first.

   (c) Having the system clock being off from the actual time can be catastrophic
as the computer would think it is a completely differnt time than it actually is
so this instruction should only be done in kernel mode to ensure that the clock
is being set to the right time and not done accidently in user mode.

   (d) The memory map should only be changed in kernel mode so that the memory is
not altered when it is not supposed to and cause issues in the programs being ran
by the operating system 

4. A process table is needed in a timesharing system to handle vital information
for each process such as register content and address space so that the process
can be restarted again later.

5. a

6. Yes, the write system can return a value
