1. Interrupt handlers deal directly with the hardware of the computer
and therefore need to be developed in a language the directly translates
to machine code. This is so because assembly does not need a runtime like
most upper-level langauges and has more direct access to the stack pointer.

2. User-space because the read() call we are familiar with requires
a lot of information such as file name and how much to read that cannot
be collected in kernel mode, therefore user-space threads would word better.

3. Each thread has a different idea what is in each register, so it would not
make sense to attempt to store a general value for the register as it would
be different for each thread.

4. 3,9,6,5
   If x < 3 put between 9 and 6
   If x = 4 put between 6 and 5
   If x = 7,8 put last
   If x > 9 put between 3 and 9

5. 61
